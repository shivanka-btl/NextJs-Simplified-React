- Two Mains
    1. App Router
        This is the newest way of doing things in Next.js. Recommends to follow this to keep up with the latest tech
    2. Pages Directory
        Even though keep up with the latest, this used to be the older platform doing with NextJs. So this is too in use.


- React vs Next
- Unlikely to the predecessor React, Next.js provides a complete ech system of client & server with built in tools to work with. Peviously on react, 
  it had the capabilities of built in client and its tools and statemanagement and router kind of very small built in support. B'cos of that limitations 
  we always had to incorporate lot of other things into the react to work with different project. Next.js provides a larger echosystem built in suite
  to make it more useful and easier to corporate. Next.js comes with a server too, this make all the server side functionality now can be incorporate with your client app side by side. 

  Also, with powerful front-end rendering it allows to partially render in server side before fully render in the client. Also, supports more server-side rendering with built in capabilities
